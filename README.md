Botilius Syrus
==================

A Twitter bot that tweets out the aphorisms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publilius_Syrus">Publilius Syrus</a> (fl. 85–43 BCE), and annotates them with emoji, as he certainly would have done if he could. 🎁

Uses the excellent <a href="https://spacy.io/">spacy.io</a> library to perform cosine similarity between
the <a href="https://archive.org/details/moralsayingspub00lymagoog">The Moral Sayings of Publius Syrus, a Roman Slave</a>
and the Unicode emoji set. I simplified the emoji names to facilitate sense-matching and added some aliases to
facilitate metonymy.
